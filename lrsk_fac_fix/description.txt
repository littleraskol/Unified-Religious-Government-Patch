Have you made a mod that adds new governments? Are at least some of those governments "religious" and so ought to count as religious governments for the Traditionalist (Spiritualist) faction? Concerned about mod inter-compatibility? Hit me up!

[b]What This Does[/b]

This edits the file "00_traditionalist.txt" to list mod-added government types as being acceptable for the "has religious government" demand of the Traditionalist (Spiritualist) faction.

[b]Background[/b]

This started as a small fix to an issue with my [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=901988941]Government Variety Pack[/url]  mod. Basically, it allowed the religious government types I added to count for the Traditionalist faction demand. This requires overwriting "00_traditionalist.txt", which makes it incompatible with any mod that does the same. For this reason, I wanted it to be separate from the main mod as an option for anyone who doesn't mind that.

After that PalmettoJedi4 asked me about compatibility with his government mod that adds a religious government. I realized it would be easy as hell to make a mod for "00_traditionalist.txt" that combines the governments of multiple mods which ought to count as religion. Thus, this patch was reborn.

Haven't tested this even a little, so while what it does is very simple (adds a few lines to one file), I can't guarantee it won't cause trouble.
